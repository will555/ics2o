		<h2>Traffic Light Essay</h2>	
<p>
Traffic lights are very helpful in everyday life to drivers and pedestrians, the timing of the lights have 
been fine tuned for each road that they are on. It would be very hard for people to get around without traffic 
lights. Traffic lights in different places are different and even the ones in canada and more specifically Ontario 
are different, with some having different properties. The pedestrian lights are also different and have different 
functions and properties.
<br> <br>
The major reason why traffic lights are so helpful is because it makes traffic run a lot more smoothly and lower 
the chance of accidents. Before there were traffic lights there was a police officer who had to control the movement
of traffic. This was difficult for police officers since they couldn’t handle changing the light of two different 
lanes. Traffic lights are now much faster than using police officers and is much safer for the cars and pedestrians. 
With the yellow light it also helps drivers even more since they can now have a better understanding for when to stop. 
Without traffic lights it would be much harder for people to get places and there would be more accidents.  
<br> <br>
There are a lot of traffic lights around the world and most of them are not the same. Some are vertical, horizontal, 
big, and small. Although they may look different they generally do the same thing with the same three lights and colours.
The biggest difference of traffic lights in Canada are the traffic lights in Quebec. These traffic lights are horizontal 
and a big difference for driving is that you are allowed to turn right on a red lights. There also always four lights and 
the two end lights are red and the two middle lights are green and yellow. The pedestrian lights are also
different all around the world with all different art styles.
<br> <br>
The traffic lights in Ottawa have different properties like flashing green for left turns, walk/don't walk 
signals, and pedestrian buttons. When there is a flashing green light it tells drivers who are turning, and
green flashing lights also mean green arrow. Walk/don’t walk signals are there to tell the pedestrians 
when to walk and when to not walk. These lights work with the main red, yellow, and green traffic lights 
to make sure that it is safe for the pedestrians to walk. The way the walk/dont walk lights know there is 
a person there is by having pedestrian buttons. These buttons allow the pedestrians to walk when they need to and make
the lights change faster than they normally would. The last property I will talk about are traffic light sensors. These
sensors allow the traffic lights to sense when there is a car in a certain position. Having these sensors allow traffic
to run more smoothly and make it so someone is not waiting for a traffic light to turn green when no one is there.
<br> <br>
Even though traffic lights are not perfect they are very beneficial to the movement and safety of drivers, 
and without these light there could be a lot more accident and even deaths.
