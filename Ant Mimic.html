		<h1>Identity Theft and Using Passwords </h1>

			<h2>Why Use a Password:</h2>

				<p>Having a password is the easiest way to prove your identity when logging in to something like, 
					Gmail, accounts, your computer, etc. When you are using a strong password your personal info is 
					protected from people who want to steal it. Having a password is a very good way to counter identity 
					theft.</p>

			<h2>How a Password should look like:</h2>
				
				<p>A password that you are using for your account should be strong so nobody will be able to access your account,
				this is what it should look like. A good password should have a minimum of 12 characters. It should also include numbers,
				symbols, capital letters, and lower-case letters. You should also mix around where you put each type of character to make
				your password even better.
				</p>
				
			<h2>When to save your Password:</h2>
						
				<p>Often when using google chrome you will be asked if you will like to save your password.
				Even though google chrome is asking, it doesn't mean you should always say yes to it. Whenever
				there is a picture of a lock in the URL that is green and beside it says “Secure”, then it is
				usually safe to save. When you think it might not be secure you should never save, just to be safe.

				<p>Identity theft is a crime in which a person obtains your personal information,
				like your Social Security or driver's license numbers, so they can impersonate someone else.
				This information can be used to get credit, goods or products, and services as you, or to
				provide the thief with fake credentials. In addition to running up debt, the thief might
				provide false information to the police, creating a criminal record or leaving ongoing arrest
				warrants for the person whose identity has been stolen.

				</center>
						<ul>

							<li>If they have any contact information and whether or not it is real.</li>
							<li>If the website has a lot of grammar and spelling mistakes.</li>
							<li>Check for the green secure lock in the URL.</li>
							<li>Check the about us part of the website and see if it is legitimate.</li>
						</ul>

			<h2>How to prevent identity theft:</h2>
			
			
						<ul>
							<li>Don’t carry your social security card in your wallet and only give out your social 
							security number when absolutely necessary.</li>
							<li>Don’t respond to unsolicited requests for personal information (your name, birthdate, social security number, or bank account number) by phone, mail, or online.</li>
							<li>Watch out for people looking at your code in when putting it in a ATM. Shield the keypad when typing your passwords on computers and at ATMs.</li>
							<li>Collect mail immediately.</li>
							<li>Pay attention to your billing cycles. If bills or financial statements are late, contact the sender.</li>
							<li>Review your receipts. Promptly compare receipts with account statements. Watch for unauthorized transactions.</li>
							<li>Shred receipts, credit offers, account statements, and expired cards, to prevent “dumpster divers” from getting your personal information.</li>
							<li>Store personal information in a safe place at home and at work.</li>
							<li>Install firewalls and virus-detection software on your home computer.</li>
							<li>Create complex passwords that identity thieves cannot guess easily. Change your passwords if a company that you do business with has a breach of its databases/li>
							<li>Order your credit report once a year and review to be certain that it doesn't include accounts that you have not opened.
							Check it more frequently if you suspect someone has gained access to your account information.</li>
						</ul>
