	<p>I would have to take computer science in grade 10, 11, and in grade 12.</p>
	
		<h2>What program of study at a university or college would help lead to this job?</h2>
	
	<p>I would have to go to university and I would get a degree in computer science and
	in math. The university I would go to is the University of Toronto since it has the best
	computer science program in Canada</p>
	
		<h2>What specific topics should I try to learn?</h2>
	
	<p>THese are the required skills and responsibilities that I will need as a wed developer for Rogers</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Creating highly interactive single page applications using Angular.js and React.js that respond to all user actions in fractions of a second</li>

		<h2>how do I think jobs and computers might change before I reach my goal?</h2>
	
	<p>I think they will change a lot since technology is always evolving and getting better and faster.
	Even the languages I need to learn can change vary drastically which means I will have to
	learn new things to keep up to date. Since it is going to be a long journey before I reach my goal
	most likely everything is going to change and get better and faster.
